The name `TestArrowDehumanize` suggests that the test is focused on the dehumanizing functionality of the `Arrow` class.\n\n- `arrow.locales.Locale` and all the specific locale classes like `arrow.locales.GermanBaseLocale`, `arrow.locales.LuxembourgishLocale`, etc.: These are likely being tested because the dehumanizing functionality of the `Arrow` class would need to work correctly across different locales. The test class name `TestArrowDehumanize` suggests that it is testing the dehumanizing functionality, which would involve converting human-readable date and time information back into a machine-readable format. This process can vary across different locales due to differences in language and formatting conventions.",

Can you please return a similar JSON object of only the source code classes/modules (with their qualified path like I have shown below), that you believe the test class/module is meant to test? You may want to pay attention to the naming of the test class/module, and the source code classes/modules themselves (comparing the source code names to the test name), how the code of the unit tests of the test class/module calls the source code from specific classes/modules, and the depth of which different source code from classes/modules are invoked (some of the source code classes/modules may be used directly in the unit test code of the test class/module, whilst others are calls made within source code classes/modules themselves). Your answers should be source code classes or modules, not functions, as we are focusing on the class/module level. Can you also explain why you believe each source code class/module you chose is in fact being tested? \n\n{\n    \"tests.test_locales.TestSamiLocale\": [\n        \"arrow.locales.Locale\",\n        \"arrow.arrow.Arrow\"\n    ]\n}"
