The function `parse` in the `TzinfoParser` class from the `arrow.parser` module is the only function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to parse timezone information, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_parser.TestTzinfoParser.test_parse_utc_withoffset\": [\n        \"arrow.parser.TzinfoParser.parse\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.parser.TzinfoParser.parse`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_parse_utc_withoffset`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_parser.py%22%2C%22test_parse_utc_withoffset%22%5D \"tests/test_parser.py\") suggests that it is testing the parsing of UTC time with an offset.

The `get` function's responsibility is to generate `Arrow` objects, which aligns with the purpose of the test. The test is specifically checking that a `TypeError` is raised when two `object` arguments are passed to the `get` method, which suggests that the test is designed to verify the error handling behavior of the `get` method when it receives unexpected input types.",

The function `_format_relative` in the `Locale` class from the `arrow.locales` module is the only function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to format relative time, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_locales.TestNewNorwegianLocale.test_format_relative_now\": [\n        \"arrow.locales.Locale._format_relative\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.locales.Locale._format_relative`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_format_relative_now`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_locales.py%22%2C%22test_format_relative_now%22%5D \"tests/test_locales.py\") suggests that it is testing the formatting of relative time for the \"now\" timeframe.

The function `get` in the `ArrowFactory` class from the `arrow.factory` module is the main function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to generate `Arrow` objects, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_factory.TestGet.test_no_args\": [\n        \"arrow.factory.ArrowFactory.get\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.factory.ArrowFactory.get`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_no_args`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_factory.py%22%2C%22test_no_args%22%5D \"tests/test_factory.py\") suggests that it is testing the behavior of the `get` method when it is called with no arguments. The `get` function's responsibility is to generate `Arrow` objects, which aligns with the purpose of the test. The other functions listed (`Arrow.utcnow`, `Arrow.__sub__`, `Arrow.__init__`, `Arrow.tzinfo`) are helper methods used within the `get` method, and while they are invoked during the test, they are not the primary focus of the test.",

The function `_ordinal_number` in the `FrenchBaseLocale` class from the `arrow.locales` module is the main function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to format ordinal numbers, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_locales.TestFrenchLocale.test_ordinal_number\": [\n        \"arrow.locales.FrenchBaseLocale._ordinal_number\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.locales.FrenchBaseLocale._ordinal_number`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_ordinal_number`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_locales.py%22%2C%22test_ordinal_number%22%5D \"tests/test_locales.py\") suggests that it is testing the formatting of ordinal numbers in the French locale. The `_ordinal_number` function's responsibility is to format ordinal numbers, which aligns with the purpose of the test. The other function listed (`Locale.ordinal_number`) is a helper method used within the `_ordinal_number` method, and while it is invoked during the test, it is not the primary focus of the test.",

The function `_format_relative` in the `Locale` class from the `arrow.locales` module is the only function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to format relative time, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_locales.TestTamilLocale.test_format_relative_future\": [\n        \"arrow.locales.Locale._format_relative\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.locales.Locale._format_relative`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_format_relative_future`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_locales.py%22%2C%22test_format_relative_future%22%5D \"tests/test_locales.py\") suggests that it is testing the formatting of relative time for future timeframes in the Tamil locale.

The function `get` in the `ArrowFactory` class from the `arrow.factory` module is the main function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to create an `Arrow` object, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_factory.TestGet.test_two_args_date_tzinfo\": [\n        \"arrow.factory.ArrowFactory.get\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.factory.ArrowFactory.get`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_two_args_date_tzinfo`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_factory.py%22%2C%22test_two_args_date_tzinfo%22%5D \"tests/test_factory.py\") suggests that it is testing the `get` function of the `ArrowFactory` class with two arguments: a date and a timezone info. The `get` function's responsibility is to create an `Arrow` object, which aligns with the purpose of the test. The other functions listed (`Arrow.fromdate`, `Arrow.__init__`) are helper methods used within the `get` method, and while they are invoked during the test, they are not the primary focus of the test.",

The function `range` in the `Arrow` class from the `arrow.arrow` module is the main function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to generate a range of `Arrow` objects, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_arrow.TestArrowRange.test_aware_same_tz\": [\n        \"arrow.arrow.Arrow.range\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.arrow.Arrow.range`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_aware_same_tz`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_arrow.py%22%2C%22test_aware_same_tz%22%5D \"tests/test_arrow.py\") suggests that it is testing the `range` function of the `Arrow` class with timezone-aware datetime objects that have the same timezone. The `range` function's responsibility is to generate a range of `Arrow` objects, which aligns with the purpose of the test. The other functions listed (`_get_datetime`, `__le__`, `shift`, `datetime`, `_get_frames`, `_get_iteration_params`, `fromdatetime`, `_get_tzinfo`, `__init__`, [`tzinfo`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_arrow.py%22%2C%22tzinfo%22%5D \"tests/test_arrow.py\"), `__getattr__`) are helper methods used within the `range` method, and while they are invoked during the test, they are not the primary focus of the test.",

The function [`_ordinal_number`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22arrow%2Flocales.py%22%2C%22_ordinal_number%22%5D \"arrow/locales.py\") in the [`EsperantoLocale`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22arrow%2Flocales.py%22%2C%22EsperantoLocale%22%5D \"arrow/locales.py\") class from the `arrow.locales` module is the main function being called in the test, and its responsibility is to format ordinal numbers in the Esperanto language, which aligns with the purpose of the test.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the function that is being tested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_locales.TestEsperantoLocale.test_ordinal_number\": [\n        \"arrow.locales.EsperantoLocale._ordinal_number\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `arrow.locales.EsperantoLocale._ordinal_number`: This function is likely being tested because the name of the test [`test_ordinal_number`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22tests%2Ftest_locales.py%22%2C%22test_ordinal_number%22%5D \"tests/test_locales.py\") suggests that it is testing the [`_ordinal_number`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22arrow%2Flocales.py%22%2C%22_ordinal_number%22%5D \"arrow/locales.py\") function of the [`EsperantoLocale`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22arrow%2Flocales.py%22%2C%22EsperantoLocale%22%5D \"arrow/locales.py\") class. The [`_ordinal_number`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22arrow%2Flocales.py%22%2C%22_ordinal_number%22%5D \"arrow/locales.py\") function's responsibility is to format ordinal numbers in the Esperanto language, which aligns with the purpose of the test.

You may want to pay attention to the naming of the unit test, and the functions themselves (comparing the function names to the unit test name), how the code of the unit tests calls functions with specific arguments, and the depth of which a function is called (some of the functions may be called directly in the unit test code, whilst others are calls made within functions).

Additionally, the test is directly calling these functions with specific arguments to verify their behavior in different scenarios. \n\nHere is the JSON object you requested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_locales.TestLuxembourgishLocale.test_weekday\": [\n        \"arrow.locales.Locale.day_abbreviation\",\n        \"arrow.locales.Locale.day_name\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe functions `arrow.locales.Locale.day_abbreviation` and `arrow.locales.Locale.day_name` are being tested to ensure that they correctly return the day abbreviation and full day name, respectively, in the Luxembourgish locale. The test checks this by providing a specific date and asserting that the output matches the expected day abbreviation and name.",

The test checks this by attempting to subtract the Arrow object from an object of an unrecognized type and expecting a TypeError to be raised.",

Additionally, the test is directly calling this function with specific arguments to verify its behavior in different scenarios. \n\nHere is the JSON object you requested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"tests.test_parser.TestDateTimeParserISO.test_parse_iso_with_extra_words_at_start_and_end_invalid\": [\n        \"arrow.parser.DateTimeParser.parse_iso\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe function `arrow.parser.DateTimeParser.parse_iso` is being tested to ensure that it correctly raises a `ParserError` when attempting to parse a string that contains extra words at the start and end of the ISO formatted date. The test checks this by providing a list of invalid inputs and asserting that a `ParserError` is raised for each one.",
