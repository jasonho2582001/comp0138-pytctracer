# PyTCTracer
PyTCTracer is a test-to-code traceability approach and library, which allows for dynamic code tracing of Python repositories using the Pytest testing framework, and automatic generation of test-to-code traceability links from the trace data using a number of established traceability techniques. 

This library forms part of an undergraduate research project for a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science at UCL (University College London).
